      First of all, thanks for visiting this site. It means a lot to me to be able to share the things I've
      been working on with others. That is, after all, what I believe software development is all about.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      I've spent the majority of my professional life creating products for people to enjoy, and my goal
      is to continue to do so in the software industry. Whether it be tinkering with a Raspberry Pi, building
      a new app, or assembling my own gaming pc, I love creating things with technology.
    </h3>

    <h3>
      If you have an opportunity for me to help create something great, please let me know!</p>
